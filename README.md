# DrewCollins.net
DrewCollins.net is my own proffesional website I'm building. I plan to include certbot for https access. More front end design through CSS grid box,javascript, and maybe even React.JS.
I plan on also learning some Node.JS and MySQL or PostGreSQL with this site.
I built the server using nginx, port forwarding, and a RPi 3B+.
